# Agent Coordination Guide

## Overview

This document details how AI agents should work with this project, including skill assignments and coordination patterns.

## Skill Assignments

### Primary Skill
- **Name**: {{primary_skill}}
- **Role**: Project lead and primary implementation
- **Capabilities**: {{primary_skill_capabilities}}

### Secondary Skills
{{secondary_skills_list}}

## Loading Skills

Load skills in order of priority:

```
{{skill_load_commands_full}}
```

## Coordination Workflow

1. **Primary agent** takes lead on core implementation
2. **Secondary agents** provide domain-specific expertise
3. **Results** are consolidated by the primary agent

## Project-Specific Guidance

### Category: {{primary_category}}

The project was detected as **{{primary_category}}**-focused. Use the primary skill for domain-specific work:

- Infrastructure provisioning and configuration
- Domain-specific manifest/code generation
- Best-practice validation and review

### Suggested Execution Order

1. Load primary skill and review project requirements
2. Generate infrastructure scaffolding
3. Load secondary skills for cross-cutting concerns
4. Validate and test generated artifacts

## Error Handling

If a skill is not available:
1. Skip the skill in the execution chain
2. Document the gap in implementation
3. Provide alternative approaches
4. Continue with remaining skills
