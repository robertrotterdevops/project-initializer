# Agent Coordination Guide

## Overview

This document details how AI agents should work with this project, including skill assignments and coordination patterns.

## Skill Assignments

### Primary Skill
- **Name**: devops-02-2026
- **Role**: Project lead and primary implementation
- **Capabilities**: elasticsearch-sizing, openshift-deployment, eck-operator, capacity-planning

### Secondary Skills
- **kubernetes-k8s-specialist**: Supplementary expertise
- **platform-engineering**: Supplementary expertise
- **devops-general**: Supplementary expertise

## Loading Skills

Load skills in order of priority:

```
load skill devops-02-2026
load skill kubernetes-k8s-specialist
load skill platform-engineering
load skill devops-general
```

## Coordination Workflow

1. **Primary agent** takes lead on core implementation
2. **Secondary agents** provide domain-specific expertise
3. **Results** are consolidated by the primary agent

## Project-Specific Guidance

### Category: elasticsearch

The project was detected as **elasticsearch**-focused. Use the primary skill for domain-specific work:

- Infrastructure provisioning and configuration
- Domain-specific manifest/code generation
- Best-practice validation and review

### Suggested Execution Order

1. Load primary skill and review project requirements
2. Generate infrastructure scaffolding
3. Load secondary skills for cross-cutting concerns
4. Validate and test generated artifacts

## Error Handling

If a skill is not available:
1. Skip the skill in the execution chain
2. Document the gap in implementation
3. Provide alternative approaches
4. Continue with remaining skills
